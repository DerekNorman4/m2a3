  <h2>Our mission</h2>
  <p>Our mission is to find you your perfect pair of gear be it Skis or Snowboards.
     A lot of thought goes into the selection process for skis and snowboards and 
     there is a lot to take into consideration when achieving the perfect fit. Head over to the Ski or Snowboard section to learn more
     about what piece of gear is best for you!
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Skis</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of skis out there, making the task of finding the right pair for you feel like an enormous undertaking.
     But with a basic understanding of the different types of skis, how camber and rocker work and how to choose the right length,
      you’ll be able to narrow down the selection and get out on the snow.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Snowboards</h2>
  <p>Like to cruise groomed runs? Float through powder? Hammer chutes? Or ride the rails? The right snowboard for you is one designed for the terrain you prefer.

    The learning curve on a snowboard is very fast, so if you’re a beginner, 
    you should consider buying for where you want to be and aim for a board that will accommodate 
    improving skills.
