<h1> Types of Skis</h1>
<h3> All-Mountain Skis </h3>
<div id="skis-content">
<img src="images/all-mountain-skis.jpg" />
<p>
These are the most versatile, all-condition, all-terrain skis. All-mountain skis are medium-width which helps handle both hard snow and powder and the rocker which helps with turns in all conditions.

<h3> Big-Mountain Skis </h3>
<div id="skis-content">
<img src="images/big-mountain-skis.jpg" />
<p>
A ski for the experts looking to take on big slopes with a lot of speed. The big-mountain category joins the width of powder skis with some of the speedy qualities of the racers. Not a great choice for beginners but for those experts ready to take it to the next level, this type of ski is a great choice.

<h3> Backcountry Skis </h3>

<p>
the backcountry subset is a response to more skiers seeing out-of-bounds terrain. These skis are typically lighter in weight and some feature notches for attaching climbing skins, which is convenient for backcountry skiers. But they are slightly more prone to damage due to their light weight and aren’t the best choice for hard snow. Unless you frequently trek and ski backcountry you might be better off with another type of ski, as other skis can handle backcountry terrain too.

<h3> Carving Skis </h3>

<p>
Best for inbounds, groomed terrain, carving skis are all about creating refined sharp turns and gaining serious speed. This type of ski is essentially a recreational version of racing skis and is a good choice for those considering racing or those who want to take on mostly groomed trails.

<h3> Freestyle Skis </h3>

<img  src="images/freestyle-skis.jpg" />
<p>
Freestyle Skis are skis made for landing tricks. They are typically short skis, with both the front and back tips pointed up to ensure smooth landings and easy transitions to backwards skiing. Though the initial purpose for these skis was rooted in completing tricks, it’s not uncommon to see these skis all over the mountain, as people love their maneuverability.
</p>
</div>

<h3> Powder Skis </h3>

<p>
These skis are for the powder days. Known for their wide body, these skies are best for days on the mountain tackling deep, light snow. Popular in the West, this might be the everyday choice for those who can depend on the fluffy stuff but you won’t likely find these skis tackling hard snow.
