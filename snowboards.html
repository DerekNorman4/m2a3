<h1 class="section-title"> Types of Snowboards</h1>
<h3> All-Mountain Snowboard </h3>
<div>

<p>
    All-mountain snowboards are the most popular snowboard as they’re designed to perform well anywhere on the mountain: to float well on powder surface, carve on the pistes and handle lumps and bumps.
Most snowboarders use the all mountain because of its versatility, it is great for beginners too. If you’re going to buy one snowboard, then it makes sense to choose one that can take you anywhere.
An all-mountain board comes with a directional shape, which means that the tip is different from its tail. The tail is generally narrower, shorter and flatter compared to the tip.
This makes the position on the all-mountain board usually more balanced towards the tail. Despite the directional shape, 
it can also be ridden backwards with the tail facing in the direction of travel.

<h3> Freestyle Snowboard </h3>

<p>
Freestyle snowboards are light, short and flexible, designed mainly for performing tricks in terrain parks and halfpipes. 
They have a limited edge grip and are not stable enough for carving turns and travelling fast.
Some freestyle snowboards have either twin tips or directional-twin. The tip and tail of the twin tip board is symmetrical in shape with a centered stance.
This design makes it easier for beginners to ride both forward and backward. The directional-twin, on the other hand, is similar to the twin tip with the only difference being the tail, which is stiffer than the tip.

<h3> Alpine Snowboard </h3>
<div>
<img  src="images/alpine-snowboards.jpg" class="snowboard-type"/>
<p>
The alpine is narrower compared to all mountain and freestyle, configured for riding and carving downhill and not suitable for performing tricks.
The long, narrow and stiff design is meant for higher speed and cleaner carved turns. 
The alpine is ideal if you are looking for a board that will deliver quick edge turns and stability for speed.
The alpine is both symmetrical and asymmetrical and only has a shovel on the tip unlike the all mountain and freestyle which has shovels at both ends.
The construction means that, the alpine is supposed to be ridden only in one direction.

<h2>Camber</h2>
<p>
    The camber on a snowboard refers to the bottom contours of a board. 
    The downward pressure applied and released when camber is flexed from a rider’s weight initiates
     continuous edge contact with the snow and lively turns.  Before reverse camber was introduced, 
     the traditional camber was a mellow curved rise from the contact points of the tip and tail with an 
     apex at the midpoint.

</p>

<h3>Traditional Camber</h3>

<img  src="images/traditional-camber.jpg" class="responsive-image" />
<p>
Cambers have evolved over the years into different types producing different amounts of edge contacts and pressure on the snow changing the way a board turns,
pops and feels underfoot. 
The bottom contours and shapes react differently to riding styles and terrain.

<h3>Flat Camber</h3>
